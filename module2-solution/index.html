  		<p class="about">Real friendship is when your friend comes over to your house and then you both just take a nap.
        Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another, ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one. Don’t make friends who are comfortable to be with. Make friends who will force you to lever yourself up. 
        Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.</p>

   		<p class="about">Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It’s not something you learn in school. But if you haven’t learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven’t learned anything.
        A true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down. Some people go to priests. Others to poetry. I to my friends.
        Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you.</p>

  		<p class="about">There are three things that grow more precious with age; old wood to burn, old books to read, and old friends to enjoy. The love that comes from friendship is the underlying facet of a happy life.
		As much as a BFF can make you go WTF, there’s no denying we’d be a little less rich without them. The only way to have a friend is to be one.
        A friend is one who knows you and loves you just the same.</p>
